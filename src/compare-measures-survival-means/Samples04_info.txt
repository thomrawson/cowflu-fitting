Priors;

   alpha ~ Uniform(min = 0, max = 0.1)
   beta ~ Uniform(min = 0.05, max = 3) #maybe 1 and 2.5
   gamma ~ Uniform(min = 0.05, max = 2) #0 and 1
   sigma ~ Uniform(min = 0.05, max = 2) #0 and 2
   asc_rate ~ Beta(a = 1, b = 1)

Far tighter priors and beta in the model code was replaced with beta/gamma (this is an error and is now changed to beta*gamma, meaning that the "beta" being fit is actually beta/gamma.
